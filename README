*Ticket Service Homework*

Implement a simple ticket service that facilitates the discovery,
temporary hold, and final reservation of seats within a high-demand
performance venue.

Assumption: JDK 1.8 will be avalable for the build process.  Solution
relies upon API elements that do not exist in prior versions.


gradle is the project build tool.  Version 2.12 was used for this
project.  If a different version is installed on the buld system, use
the includede gradlew (or gradlew.bat).  While the default installd
gradle may work, build instruction will use the *nix ./gradlew
variant.

Venue.java contains the primary class that ties all the others together.
